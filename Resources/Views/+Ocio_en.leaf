                    <h2>History and Motivation</h2>
                    <p>
                        +Ocio was born from a radical shift in the original "Baretos Baratos" project. Initially, the idea focused on creating a platform for bars and restaurants, but after a thorough feasibility study and the legal and financial limitations that arose, the concept was completely transformed.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        In light of the economic challenges young people face today, with low wages, high rents, and the ever-increasing cost of living, we decided to rethink the app to turn it into an affordable social enhancer. With +Ocio, we aim to offer a platform that facilitates the organization of low-cost plans and social events, fostering interaction and creating shared experiences among young people.

                    <h2>New Vision</h2>
                    <p>
                        The app now focuses on providing users with a tool to find, organize, and share affordable social plans. Users can browse through a variety of activities, whether to explore their city, organize outings, or participate in group events.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        +Ocio now dedicates an entire section to planning on your calendar different proposals for plans. Whether fixed plans or pending proposals, the user can extract the ideas from the app and keep track of how sociable they are being (sometimes we need to see things written out that we already know to be aware of reality, and in this case, it could help prevent unhealthy social habits that can lead to dark times and depressions).

                        The plans are displayed in a card format, allowing users to select and save those they are interested in. These can include everything from camping trips to small social events in the city.

                        The interface allows users to discover a limited number of plans, and they will have to scroll through Tinder-style to see all the plans.
                        The more plans you complete, the more plan cards you'll be able to see each day! Upon discovering a new plan, you can:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skip/burn it</li>
                        <li>Plan it in the calendar by proposing a location, time, and with which app users you want to spend your time.</li>
                        <li>Share the plan through other platforms (for people who still don't use +Ocio).</li>
                        <li>Save the plan because you're not sure yet and want to see a few more cards. You can only have 3 plans saved, so you'll have to make the plans happen or burn the plan and accept that you won't do it.</li>
