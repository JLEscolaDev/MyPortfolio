            <h2>My Entrepreneurship Story</h2>
            <p>In my quest to explore new ways of generating passive income with minimal human intervention, I embarked on an innovative project that combined artificial intelligence, graphic design, and e-commerce. The central idea was to leverage emerging AI capabilities like DALL·E and Midjourney to create unique and attractive designs that could be applied to a variety of products for direct-to-consumer sales.</p>

        <section class="phase-section">
            <h2>Conceptualization and Design Phase</h2>
            <p>The process began with an intense phase of research and experimentation. I used DALL·E and Midjourney via Discord to generate base images, exploring different styles and concepts that could resonate with consumers. These AI tools allowed me to quickly produce a wide range of designs, from abstract patterns to thematic illustrations.</p>
            <p>To refine and customize these designs, I incorporated graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, and GIMP...</p>

            <h2>Developing an Automated System</h2>
            <p>With the designs ready, the next step was to establish an automated system that minimized human intervention in production and distribution. I opted for Printful, a print-on-demand platform that easily integrates with online stores and handles production, packaging, and shipping of products to the end customer. This eliminated the need to manage inventory or logistics, aligning perfectly with my goal of creating a passive income stream...</p>

            <h2>Marketing Strategies and Expanding the Catalog</h2>
            <p>Aware that some consumers might be hesitant to buy AI-designed products, I decided to diversify the catalog. I used my skills in Adobe Illustrator and GIMP to create manual designs, including motivational phrases and simple but attractive graphics...</p>

            <p>Despite efforts and the interest generated by AI-designed products, the only sales made were of manually designed items.
